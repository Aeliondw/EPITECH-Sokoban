<h1 align="center">âšª EPITECH Project - Sokoban âšª</h1>
<h2 align="center">EPITECH 1st year | Unix System Programming</h2>



## âšª DESCRIPTION
**Sokoban** is originally a Japanese **puzzle game** in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. 
If a box is blocked, you've lost. 
If all the boxes are placed on the storage locations, then you've won.


The aim of this project is to **develop in C** a copy of this game in **terminal mode**, using the **ncurses library**.
- `P` represents the player
- `X` represents a box
- `O` represents a storage location
- `#` represents a wall

  The player moves with the arrow keys.
